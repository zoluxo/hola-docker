# Hello Docker 🚀

This is my first Docker project, inspired by the book *Docker Deep Dive* by Nigel Poulton.  
The goal is to learn how to build images and run containers in a reproducible way.

## 📂 Project Files
- `app.py`: Simple Python script that prints a message.
- `Dockerfile`: Instructions to build the Docker image.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zoluxo/hola-docker.git
   cd hola-docker
